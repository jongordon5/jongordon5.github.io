Hello, my name is Jon Gordon.  Currently, I am a singer-songwriter/musician expanding my horizons in web-development.  I was born and raised in Chicago and I spent a lot of life in Atlanta, GA, Los Angeles, CA, Miami and Jupiter Island, FL.  I was the founder of a quartet R&B Group, from Chicago, called One Chance.  I am currently a founder of a duo called The Gordon Brothers. I enjoy playing basketball, learning new things, and traveling.
