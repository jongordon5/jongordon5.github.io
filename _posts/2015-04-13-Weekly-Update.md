Today has been great so far.  The city is alive. The weather is awesome. Definitely no time for complaining. 

I am a few steps away from completing a project for my first client.  It feels good to complete something that I had no knowledge of a year ago.  This is just the tip of the iceberg.

A friend of mine gave me a book (The Power Of Habit by Charles Duhigg) that appears to be interesting, I will update you as soon as I finish.

Well, I hope everyone is having a great day and I will talk to you at a later date.

Jon
