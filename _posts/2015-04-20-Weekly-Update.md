Today was great.  I learn some new thing from my friend <a href="https://github.com/anishkothari">Anish</a>.  He informed me about REST,Representational State Transfer, along with the main verbs for REST and HTTP.  The main verbs for REST and HTTP, which are also used for URL's, are GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.  I also learned about CRUD, which is CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE.

After my "fill up with knowledge" session, I ran over to the library to pick-up Head First Javascript Programming by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson, along with The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.

I have a few more things to finish with the current website I'm working and then I will be on to creating another.

Well, It's getting kind of late so until next time. Enjoy Life and Live Well!

Jon
