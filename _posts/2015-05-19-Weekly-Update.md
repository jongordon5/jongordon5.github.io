Good Evening World!

I am behind with posting about my growth and challenges with programming.  Last week, I had a very productive week beginning with learning JavaScript.  I began reading Head-First-JavaScript Programming, which seemed pretty smooth during the first couple of chapters.
When I hit chapter 6 and on, the tough got going but I made it through the entire book.  I'm still a beginner but I'm more aware of the language and how things work.  I'm going to just dive into more coding to see what works and what doesn't work.  I also attended 
a meetup, put together by the good people of <a href="http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/" title="Anyone Can Learn to Code">Anyone Can Learn To Code</a>, for Level #1 JavaScript.  I really enjoyed discovering and experiencing what was actually within the 
<a href="http://www.mmart.com/" title="Merchantdise Mart Building">Merchantdise Mart building</a>, suite 1871 has awesome energy.  I don't ever recall going inside, although I was born and raised in Chicago, IL.  

On to things that don't pertain to coding.. I attended a meetup, this past weekend, called "Music Art Grants Workshop,".  It was pretty informative about finding Grants and sponser that are willing to pay money to help keep the arts thriving.  I enjoyed it.  
Well, that's all I can remember about last week, but I will be sure to keep you posted on what this week has instored. 

Until next time.... Peace, Love, Music, and Coding.

Jon
